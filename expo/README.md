# Expo example

This example shows how create an Expo application backed by an electrified SQLite database, synching data across devices through the Cloud.

For this example we uses an electrified `expo-sqlite` driver to access SQLite on the device. The process is simple: open the database, electrify it, and use it as normal. Electric will detect database changes and synch them through the Cloud.

```jsx
export const ElectrifiedExample = () => {
  const [db, setDb] = useState<ElectrifiedDatabase>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const odb = SQLite.openDatabase('example.db');
    const init = async () => {     
      await electrify(odb as any, config as any)
        .then((db: ElectrifiedDatabase) => setDb(db))
        .catch((err) => {
          console.warn("Error electrifying database");
          console.log(JSON.stringify(err));
          throw err;
        })
      }
    init();
  }, []);

  return (
    <ElectricProvider db={db}>
      <Example />
    </ElectricProvider>
  );
};
```

To try out the example, you can run the application from ElectricSQL hosted service, or use a local development cluster. To launch the cluster you will need Makefile and Docker:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/electric-sql/electric
 cd electric
 make start\_dev\_env && make deps compile shell
```

You can tear down all containers with `make stop_dev_env`.

**Note**: youâ€™ll notice that the scripts launches two Antidote clusters and a pair of Postgres instances. This is a lot more than what we actually need for this example.

Now, clone this project and install it:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/electric-sql/examples
 cd examples/expo
 yarn
```

You can edit ElectricSQL [configurations](https://electric-sql/docs/usage/configure) in `satellite-config.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
  app: 'example-app',
  migrations: migrationsData,
};
```

When running your application from Electric service, edit `app` to match your application name.
When running Electric yourself, you can set `url` to override the location of the service ( default is "http://localhost:5133").

Run the application on the simulator or the device

```bash
 yarn run ios
```

Go ahead and try the [web](https://github.com/electric-sql/examples/tree/main/web) example and see data replication across device and browser, without any extra code to handle replication.

We are launching our hosted service soon. You can join the [waitlist](https://console.electric-sql.com/join/waitlist) to get early access.
